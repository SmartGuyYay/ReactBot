      "That was softer than a pre-season trial.",
      "Bit of a snooze take, champ.",
      "That’s the diet version of a hot take.",
      "I’ve seen spicier chat in the canteen line.",
      "That’s about as bold as picking the Panthers for top 8.",
      "Yeah… that one won’t make the headlines.",
      "Like a drizzle instead of a storm.",
      "That was a vanilla-flavoured hot take.",
      "Pretty mid, but hey, at least it’s consistent.",
      "That’s more lukewarm than a stadium pie.",
      "Congrats, you just invented the beige take.",
      "That one’s as safe as passing backwards.",
      "Bro, even the refs wouldn’t bother reviewing that.",
      "That’s the kind of chat you forget instantly.",
      "Not bad… not memorable either.",
      "Like a soft tap instead of a big hit.",
      "That’s about as risky as tipping the home team.",

      "Feels like a take written on autopilot.",
      "More background noise than headline grabber.",

      "Low effort, but at least it’s effort.",
      "That was about as exciting as a bye round.",
      "Mildly spicy, like plain nachos.",
      "Bro, you’re playing footy in slow motion.",
      "That’s a safe pass straight to the dummy half.",
      "That’s the lukewarm water of hot takes.",
      "Mate, even halftime oranges had more kick.",
      "That was softer than a stadium seat cushion.",
      "That call didn’t even raise an eyebrow.",
      "That’s like calling Coke ‘fizzy water’ — technically true, boring though.",
      "Bit flat, like a ball left out in the rain.",
      "That one came out weaker than instant coffee.",
      "Your chat’s jogging when everyone else is sprinting.",
      "That’s more plain than white bread.",
      "A soft breeze, not a storm.",
      "That’s just… beige energy.",
      "Not a howler, not a highlight. Just… there.",
      "That’s like tipping the sun to rise tomorrow.",
      "Mate, even the commentary box would yawn at that one.",
      "That’s softer than a marshmallow tackle.",
      "That’s about as edgy as a circle.",
      "The safest safe take in all the land.",
      "That’s like watching paint dry on game day.",
      "You’ve brought less heat than a broken microwave.",
      "Not terrible, not memorable either.",
      "That’s the lukewarm beer of opinions.",
      "That was a whisper, not a shout.",
      "That’s the light beer of hot takes.",
      "That was quieter than a library on Tuesday.",
      "Like a practice drill, not the real match.",
      "That’s the soft serve of roasts.",
      "That take was asleep before it started.",
      "That’s a shrug in sentence form.",
      "That’s the PG-rated version of a hot take.",
      "That was less fire, more sparkler.",
      "Mate, that’s background noise chat.",
      "That’s the gentle breeze of opinions.",
      "Not spicy, just… mildly seasoned.",
      "That’s a take you’d forget by halftime.",
      "Your chat’s softer than team merch cotton.",
      "That’s about as sharp as a rubber ball.",
      "Bro, that’s the cup of tea of hot takes.",
      "That one could’ve been written by a bot.",
      "That’s like tipping rain in a thunderstorm.",
      "That’s the soft soundtrack of NRL banter.",
      "Bit plain, like unsalted chips.",
      "That’s not a roar, that’s a meow.",
      "That’s like calling Origin ‘kinda competitive.’",
